This repository contains Python codes developed for the paper "3-D Dynamic UAV Base Station Location Problem". 

DMCLP_Main: Main file to run the simulations. All the arguments and parameters should be defined in this file.

DMCLP_Gurobi: Contains necessary code to solve an instance by Gurobi solver.

DMCLP_LDA: Contains necessary code to solve an instance with the Lagrangian Decomposition Algorithm (LDA) as described in the paper.

DMCLP_LDA_DC: Contains necessary code to feed LDA with the Difference of Convex Programming (DC) tehcnique.

DMCLP_CA: Contains necessary code to solve an instance with the Continuum Approximation Algorithm (CA) as described in the paper.

DMCLP_Instance_Generator: Contains necessary code to generate discrete instances as described in the paper.

DMCLP_utils: Contains auxiliary functions that are frequently used in the other files.
